# IT6_GUESS-GAME
- How the Server-Client Interaction Works:
- The server waits for a connection and sends the banner message.
- The client receives the banner and displays it to the user.
- The client sends user input (such as difficulty choice or guesses) to the server.
- The server processes the input, updates the game state, and sends appropriate responses back to the client.
- This back-and-forth continues until the game ends or the connection is closed.
